# Diabetic_Retinopathy_DCNN

This case study is based on a Kaggle dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/

APTOS2019 kaggle dataset contains:
â€¢	train.csv - the training labels

â€¢	test.csv - the test set (you must predict the diagnosis value for these variables)

â€¢	sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

â€¢	train.zip - the training set images

â€¢	test.zip - the public test set images
